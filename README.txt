== Description ==

Imitate Email is an end-to-end email testing tool for developers and software teams.

It provides a sanbox email server (supporting SMTP/IMAP/POP3) alongside tools for checking your email content, validating syntax and enabling integration testing. 

A key feature is the embedded email viewer which can be dropped in to any web application so that developers and testers can see emails inside the software that they're testing.
